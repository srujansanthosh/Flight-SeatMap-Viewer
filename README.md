# Airline-Seatmap-Viewer

LOLA Homework

## Assignment details:
We’d like for you to build a scrollable & interactive seat map in (React, ReactNative, Angular etc.) the Javascript framework of your choice. We do use React and ReactNative at Lola, but please use whatever framework you are most comfortable with. **If you decide to use ReactNative, please fork this repo.**

The seat map should be dynamically generated by the dummy data located here: https://github.com/lolatravel/lola_seats/blob/master/data/seats.json

Here is an ugly wireframe you can use for reference, but we encourage you to not use it re: design / style / functionality. Its solely meant to illustrate a few things:

Seats have a cabin class (first, business, coach), a row (1, 2 etc.), and a letter assignment. They can be occupied, available or selected (only 1 should be selectable at a time - in the wireframe, that's the green one).
The aisle in a cabin class is determined by a missing letter in the seats (i.e. a, b, d, e - ‘c’ is missing, that’s where the aisle is).
Cabin classes should be programmatically generated to support any number of rows / columns.

To run:

Clone the repository and run 'node server.js' on the command line.
