# Airline-Seatmap-Viewer

## Assignment details:
To build a scrollable & interactive seat map in AngularJS.

The seat map should be dynamically generated by the dummy data located here: 
https://github.com/srujansanthosh/Flight-SeatMap-Viewer/blob/master/app/data/seats.json

Here is the wireframe I'm using for reference. Its solely meant to illustrate a few things:

Seats have a cabin class (first, business, coach), a row (1, 2 etc.), and a letter assignment. They can be occupied, available or selected (only 1 should be selectable at a time - in the wireframe, that's the green one).
The aisle in a cabin class is determined by a missing letter in the seats (i.e. a, b, d, e - ‘c’ is missing, that’s where the aisle is).
Cabin classes should be programmatically generated to support any number of rows / columns.

To run:

Clone the repository and run 'node server.js' on the command line.
